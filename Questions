Hey- just tested your code (working on Windows) - works great. I am no coder, but have installed and it runs fine. Quick questions 
1) Its now only checking for Group-1 which is 1hr fixed. Would like to include Group-4 which is the flexible slot. 
2) Instead of send notification - book the earliest one available and send email to confirm?

How to do this?
